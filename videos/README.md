# `videos`

This directory contains Batchfiles focused for automating mundane tasks, specifically for YouTube videos.

## Why batchfiles instead of Python, PowerShell, etc.?

As painful is it is to deal with it's ancient syntax, Batchfiles seem to be convienient
by just drag and dropping the `.bat` file as opposed to a Python or PowerShell script.
And most of my video workload is mostly on Windows for the time being, so using Batchfile
is a reasonable thing to consider without any performance hiccups.
